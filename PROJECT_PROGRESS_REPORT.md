# TRMNL BYOS Next.js Server - Progress Report

**Project:** Build Your Own Server (BYOS) for TRMNL 7.5" DIY Kit  
**Date Started:** October 16, 2025  
**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Operational  
**Last Updated:** October 16, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully built and deployed a complete BYOS (Build Your Own Server) implementation for TRMNL e-ink devices using Next.js, Supabase, and Vercel. The server is now fully operational with a physical TRMNL device successfully connected and communicating with the API.

---

## What We Built

### 1. Database Infrastructure (Supabase)

**Created Tables:**
- `devices` - Stores registered TRMNL devices with metadata
- `screens` - Stores screen configurations and content for each device
- `logs` - Tracks all API interactions and device activity

**Why:** Needed persistent storage for device management, screen content, and activity monitoring. Supabase was chosen for its PostgreSQL database, real-time capabilities, and seamless Vercel integration.

**Key Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled for data protection
- Proper indexing on device_id and foreign keys for performance
- Timestamps for tracking device activity and last seen status

### 2. API Endpoints (BYOS Specification)

**Implemented Endpoints:**

#### `/api/setup` (GET/POST)
- **Purpose:** Device registration and initial handshake
- **Why:** TRMNL devices call this endpoint first to register with the server
- **Features:** 
  - Accepts both GET (health check) and POST (registration)
  - Case-insensitive header handling for device IDs
  - Auto-creates device records with firmware version tracking

#### `/api/display` (GET)
- **Purpose:** Serves screen content to devices
- **Why:** Core endpoint that devices poll for updated content
- **Features:**
  - Auto-registration for new devices
  - Returns active screens in priority order
  - Generates default content when no screens exist
  - Updates device last_seen_at timestamp

#### `/api/log` (POST)
- **Purpose:** Receives device logs and status updates
- **Why:** Enables monitoring device health and debugging issues
- **Features:**
  - Auto-registration for new devices
  - Handles null/missing message fields gracefully
  - Stores structured log data with timestamps

#### `/api/health` (GET)
- **Purpose:** Simple health check endpoint
- **Why:** Allows quick verification that the server is responding
- **Returns:** `{"status":"ok"}`

#### `/api/diagnostics` (GET)
- **Purpose:** System-wide diagnostics and debugging
- **Why:** Needed visibility into device connections and logs during development
- **Returns:** All devices, recent logs, and counts

### 3. Dashboard & UI Components

**Pages Built:**

#### Home Page (`/`)
- Landing page with feature overview
- Quick start guide
- Links to dashboard and documentation

#### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Overview of all registered devices
- Statistics (total devices, active screens, recent logs)
- Quick access to device management
- Links to setup guide and system logs
- Password-protected access

#### Device Detail Page (`/device/[id]`)
- Individual device information
- List of screens for the device
- Recent activity logs
- Actions: create screen, view settings

#### Device Settings (`/device/[id]/settings`)
- Edit device name
- View device metadata
- Delete device (danger zone)
- Back navigation to device detail

#### Screen Management
- `/device/[id]/screen/new` - Create new screens
- `/device/[id]/screen/[screenId]` - View screen details
- `/device/[id]/screen/[screenId]/edit` - Edit existing screens

**Screen Types Supported:**
1. **Clock** - Real-time clock display
2. **Weather** - Weather information (requires API integration)
3. **Quote** - Inspirational quotes
4. **Custom** - User-defined content

#### System Logs (`/logs`)
- View all API requests across all devices
- Filter by endpoint, device, status
- Real-time activity monitoring

#### Setup Guide (`/setup-guide`)
- Step-by-step hardware assembly instructions
- Firmware flashing guide
- WiFi configuration walkthrough
- Server URL setup
- Troubleshooting tips

#### Test Device Registration (`/test-device`)
- Create virtual test devices without hardware
- Useful for development and testing
- Generates unique device IDs

### 4. Security Implementation

**Challenge:** Vercel's free tier only protects preview deployments, not production URLs.

**Solution Implemented:** Application-level password protection

**Features:**
- Middleware-based authentication
- Protected routes: `/dashboard`, `/device/*`, `/logs`, `/test-device`
- Unprotected routes: All `/api/*` endpoints (for device access)
- Login page with password verification
- Secure cookie-based session management
- Logout functionality
- Environment variable for password (`DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`)

**Why This Approach:**
- No subscription costs
- Full control over authentication logic
- API endpoints remain accessible for TRMNL devices
- Simple to configure and maintain

### 5. Screen Rendering System

**Implementation:** SVG generation for e-ink displays

**Why SVG:**
- Vector graphics scale perfectly to device resolution
- Small file size for fast transmission
- E-ink friendly (black and white)
- Easy to generate server-side

**Rendering Pipeline:**
1. Device requests content via `/api/display`
2. Server queries active screens for device
3. Generates SVG based on screen type and configuration
4. Returns image URL in JSON response
5. Device downloads and displays image

---

## Key Decisions & Why We Made Them

### 1. Auto-Registration on First Contact

**Problem:** Physical TRMNL device wasn't calling `/api/setup` before other endpoints.

**Solution:** Added auto-registration logic to `/api/display` and `/api/log`.

**Why:** 
- More resilient to different device firmware behaviors
- Reduces setup friction
- Ensures devices always work on first connection
- Gracefully handles devices that skip setup endpoint

### 2. Comprehensive Logging

**Implementation:** Console.log statements with `[v0]` prefix throughout API routes.

**Why:**
- Essential for debugging device connection issues
- Vercel function logs capture these for analysis
- Helped identify the null message field issue
- Enables real-time troubleshooting

### 3. Flexible Header Handling

**Implementation:** Case-insensitive device ID header checking (`ID`, `id`, `Id`).

**Why:**
- Different TRMNL firmware versions may use different casing
- Increases compatibility across device types
- Prevents connection failures due to header format

### 4. Default Message Handling

**Problem:** Device logs were failing with null constraint violations.

**Solution:** Provide default message when none is sent.

**Why:**
- TRMNL devices don't always send message field
- Database schema requires NOT NULL
- Better to log with default than fail silently

---

## Debugging Journey

### Issue 1: "API connection cannot be established"

**Symptoms:** Device showed WiFi connected but API error.

**Root Cause:** `/api/setup` only accepted POST, device was sending GET first.

**Fix:** Added GET handler to `/api/setup` for health checks.

### Issue 2: Device Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Symptoms:** Vercel logs showed 404 errors for device ID `10:20:BA:75:5E:A8`.

**Root Cause:** Device wasn't registered in database, only test device existed.

**Fix:** Implemented auto-registration in display and log endpoints.

### Issue 3: Log Endpoint Returning 500 Error

**Symptoms:** `/api/log` failing with database constraint violation.

**Root Cause:** Device sending null message field, database requires NOT NULL.

**Fix:** Added default message handling: `message || 'Device log entry'`.

### Issue 4: Import Errors During Deployment

**Symptoms:** Deployment failing due to missing `createServerClient` export.

**Root Cause:** Inconsistent exports in `lib/supabase/server.ts`.

**Fix:** Added re-export of `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr`.

### Issue 5: Database Query Errors

**Symptoms:** Logs page failing with "column device_name does not exist".

**Root Cause:** Query using wrong column name from schema.

**Fix:** Changed `devices(device_name)` to `devices(name)`.

- **Total:** $0/month

### Scaling Costs
- **Vercel Pro:** $20/month (if needed for production features)
- **Supabase Pro:** $25/month (if exceeding free tier limits)
- **Weather API:** $0-10/month depending on provider
- **Estimated at scale:** $45-55/month for 10-50 devices

---

## Success Metrics

### Achieved ‚úÖ
- Device successfully connects and communicates
- All API endpoints operational
- Dashboard accessible and functional
- Database storing data correctly
- Zero downtime since deployment

### To Measure
- Screen view count per device
- Average device uptime
- API response times
- User engagement with dashboard
- Screen creation rate

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Auto-registration is essential** - Devices don't always follow expected API flow
2. **Comprehensive logging saves time** - Debug logs were crucial for troubleshooting
3. **Flexible header handling matters** - Different firmware versions behave differently
4. **Default values prevent failures** - Always handle null/missing fields gracefully
5. **Test with real hardware early** - Simulators don't catch all issues
